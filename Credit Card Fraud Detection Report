Objective
The aim of this analysis is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing anonymized features, transaction amounts, and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset Overview
Dataset Name: creditcard.csv
Number of Records: 284,807 transactions
Number of Features: 31 (Time, V1-V28, Amount, and Class)
Class Distribution
Class 0 (Non-Fraudulent): ~99.8%
Class 1 (Fraudulent): ~0.2%
Visualization: The bar charts above indicate the significant class imbalance, which justifies the need for techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset.

Data Preprocessing
Missing Values:

All missing values were handled by imputing the median values for respective columns.
Feature Scaling:

The Amount feature was standardized using StandardScaler.
Imbalanced Dataset:

Addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to oversample the minority class.
Models Trained
1. Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics:
Classification Report:
Precision, Recall, F1-Score for each class.
AUC-ROC Score: Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
Results:
Accuracy: Achieved competitive results.
AUC-ROC: High score indicating good performance in distinguishing fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.
2. Random Forest
Feature Importance:
Random Forest identified the most important features contributing to fraudulent detection.
Visualization of feature importances highlighted key features like V17, V12, V14, and Amount.
Evaluation Metrics:
Similar to Logistic Regression, Random Forest was evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC Score.
Results:
Achieved better results compared to Logistic Regression due to its ensemble nature and ability to handle non-linear relationships.
SHAP Analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used for interpretability:

Visualized how individual features contributed to model predictions.
Generated a summary plot indicating feature impact.
Visualization Highlights
Class Distribution:

Visualized significant imbalance in classes, highlighting the rarity of fraudulent transactions.
Feature Importances (Random Forest):

Key features influencing predictions were identified and plotted.
SHAP Summary Plot:

Interpreted the contribution of features to predictions, aiding model transparency.
Model Deployment
Using Flask or Streamlit, the trained model can be deployed to provide predictions for new transaction data:

Streamlit Interface:
File upload functionality for transaction data.
Real-time predictions displayed for the user.
Conclusion
The combination of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models provided insights into the dataset.
SMOTE effectively handled class imbalance, improving model performance.
Deployment with Flask or Streamlit ensures practical utility for real-world scenarios.
